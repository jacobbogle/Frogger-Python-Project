Frogger Documentation
=====================

FroggerLib Objects
------------------

We provide a selection of class definitions for you to use in implementing your
game. They are structured into a single package called ``froggerlib`` that you
can import like this:

``import froggerlib``

Use this package as a namespace to any of the classes that you use when building
your game. For example, you may access the ``Frog`` class like this (arguments
omitted):

``froggerlib.Frog(...)``

Below is a list of documentation for some of the ``froggerlib`` classes along
with some other useful hints that you may reference.
