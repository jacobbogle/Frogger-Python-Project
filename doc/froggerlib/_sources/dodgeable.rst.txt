Dodgeable
---------

Defines how specific objects collide with other objects. These so called
"dodgeables" are the ``RaceCar``, ``Dozer``, ``Truck``, and ``Car`` classes.

You shouldn't directly create an instance of ``Dodgeable`` but consider the
description below of the hit method that is accessible on any object that
inherits from ``Dodgeable``.

.. py:class:: Dodgeable

    .. py:method:: hits(other)

       Determines if the given object (other) hits or touches the current object
       (self), according to both objects' position, width, and height.

       Hint: the other object should be the frog.

       :param other: The other object to be compared with.
       :type other: ``Locatable``
       :return: Whether or not the other object touches the current object.
       :rtype: bool
