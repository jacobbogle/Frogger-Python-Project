Dozer
-----

``Dozer`` objects have identical interfaces as ``Car`` objects. Therefore, you
should refer to the ``Car`` class to understand the specification of the
``Dozer`` class.

.. py:class:: Dozer(x, y, w, h, dx, dy, s)

    See the ``Car`` class documentation for descriptions of the parameters.
