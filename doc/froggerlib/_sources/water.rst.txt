Water
-----

A ``Water`` object represents the lanes in the bottom half of the window where
cars will move. Above the middle stage, there should be at least four water
lanes in the game window.

.. py:class:: Water(x, y, w, h)

   .. py:attribute:: x

       The position of the water lane in the x dimension; its left edge.

       :type x: int or float

   .. py:attribute:: y

       The position of the water lane in the y dimension; its top edge.

       :type y: int or float

   .. py:attribute:: w

       The width of the water lane.

       :type w: int or float

   .. py:attribute:: h

       The height of the water lane.

       :type h: int or float

    .. py:method:: hits(other)

       Determines if the given object (other) hits or touches the water lane
       (self), according to both objects' position, width, and height.

       Hint: the other object should be the frog.

       :param other: The other object to be compared with.
       :type other: ``Locatable``
       :return: Whether or not the other object touches the current object.
       :rtype: bool
