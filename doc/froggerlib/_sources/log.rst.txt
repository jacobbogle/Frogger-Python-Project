Log
---

A ``Log`` object should automatically move horizontally across the window
Through inheritance, Log objects include attributes from the ``Locatable``,
``Movable``, and ``Rideable`` classes. You should reference the documentation
pages of these classes when implementing each log's behavior in your game.

.. py:class:: Log(x, y, w, h, dx, dy, s)

   .. py:attribute:: x

       The starting x value of the position of the log. This should be used as
       its left edge (as defined in pygame).

       You have a few options for where to place a log when the game begins.
       Most find it useful to randomize this position to some value within the
       width of the window.

       :type x: int or float

   .. py:attribute:: y

       The y value of the position of the log. This should be used as its top
       edge (as defined in pygame).

       To determine the y value of a log, think of what road lane you want to
       place it in and use its value.

       :type y: int or float

   .. py:attribute:: w

       The width of the log.

       :type w: int or float

   .. py:attribute:: h

       The height of the log.

       :type h: int or float

   .. py:attribute:: dx

       The desired x value of the log. It is the point in the x dimension toward
       which the log will automatically move.

       Ideally, this should be set to some value off of the screen so that it
       appears to continue driving. We will reset the log's position once it is
       off of the screen but we don't want the user to notice that we reset it.

       :type dx: int or float

   .. py:attribute:: dy

       The desired y value of the log. It is the point in the y dimension toward
       which the log will automatically move.

       Since the log should only move horizontally, we do not want its y value
       to change. To ensure this, we recommend you set the desired y using the
       starting y value described above.

       :type dy: int or float

   .. py:attribute:: s

       The speed of the log.

       :type s: int or float
