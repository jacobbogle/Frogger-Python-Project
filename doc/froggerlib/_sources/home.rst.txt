A ``Home`` object represents the spaces in the top row of the window separating
the ``Grass`` spaces. The player wins when the frog reaches a ``Home`` space.

.. py:class:: Home(x, y, w, h)

   .. py:attribute:: x

       The position of the home space in the x dimension; its left edge.

       :type x: int or float

   .. py:attribute:: y

       The position of the home space in the y dimension; its top edge.

       :type y: int or float

   .. py:attribute:: w

       The width of the home space.

       :type w: int or float

   .. py:attribute:: h

       The height of the home space.

       :type h: int or float

    .. py:method:: hits(other)

       Determines if the given object (other) hits or touches the home space
       (self), according to both objects' position, width, and height.

       Hint: the other object should be the frog.

       :param other: The other object to be compared with.
       :type other: ``Locatable``
       :return: Whether or not the other object touches the current object.
