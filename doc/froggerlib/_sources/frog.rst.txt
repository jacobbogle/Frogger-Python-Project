Frog
----

A ``Frog`` object is controlled by the player to move throughout the game.
Through inheritance, Frog objects include attributes from the ``Locatable``,
``Movable``, and ``PlayerControllable`` classes. You should reference the
documentation pages of these classes when implementing the frog's behavior in
your game.

.. py:class:: Frog(x,y,w,h,dx,dy,s,hg,vg)

   .. py:attribute:: x

       The x value of the position of the frog. This should be used as its left
       edge (as defined in pygame).

       :type x: int or float

   .. py:attribute:: y

       The y value of the position of the frog. This should be used as its top
       edge (as defined in pygame).

       :type y: int or float

   .. py:attribute:: w

       The width of the frog.

       :type w: int or float

   .. py:attribute:: h

       The height of the frog.

       :type h: int or float

   .. py:attribute:: dx

       The desired x value of the frog. The point in the x dimension toward
       which the frog will automatically move.

       Set this to the frog's x value since the frog should not move automatically.

       :type dx: int or float

   .. py:attribute:: dy

       The desired y value of the frog. The point in the y dimension toward
       which the frog will automatically move.

       Set this to the frog's y value since the frog should not move automatically.

       :type dy: int or float

   .. py:attribute:: s

       The speed of the frog.

       :type s: int or float

   .. py:attribute:: hg

       The horizontal gap of the frog, representing how far the frog will jump
       in the horizontal plane when pressing the left or right arrow keys.

       :type hg: int or float

   .. py:attribute:: vg

       The vertical gap of the frog, representing how far the frog will jump
       in the vertical plane when pressing the up or down arrow keys.

       :type vg: int or float
